# Elimination Matrix

## Elimination
We shall begin this chapter with a systematic way to solve linear equations with n variables. Consider the following set of equations where n = 3:

$$
\begin{cases}
&x &+ &2&y &+ &z &= &2\\
3&x &+ &8&y &+ &z &= &12\\
&&&4&y &+ &z &= &2
\end{cases}
$$

which would correspond to the coefficient matrix:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1&2&1\\3&8&1\\0&4&1
\end{bmatrix}
$$
